# Coding Chronicles

Welcome to Coding Chronicles, a captivating repository where I chronicle my coding journey and share valuable learnings with fellow enthusiasts.

To achieve a visually appealing and responsive design, I have utilized a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** in my code. Additionally, to power the backend, I have incorporated the use of **Python** with the **Flask** framework. And to manage the data efficiently, I have implemented a **SQLITE** database that stores all the necessary information.
